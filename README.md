# Full Stack Web Development
Personal contributions to Gourmet Swap, a social market built off the idea connecting communities to home-cooked meals prepared by local Chefs. Example codes include the following technologies: ASP.NET MVC / C#, REST Web API, Angular, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

Web Application notes:
1) Web app is a Single Page Application - using ASP.NET Web API and AngularJS.
2) URL routing is accomplished by using AngularJS UI-Router - a client-side Single Page Application routing framework.
3) Follow John Popa's AngularJS style guide for syntax and application structure.
4) Client and server side follows the MVC architectural pattern - using AngularJS and ASP.NET.
5) Server side enforces dependency injection (DI) design pattern - to promote a loosely coupled application. Unity container used to resolve dependencies. 
6) Use ASP.NET Web API and ADO.NET to create REST based services (RESTful APIs), use AngularJS Controllers / Services to request data from the Web APIs to serve data to AngularJS Views
