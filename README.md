# Gourmet Swap
Contributions to a startup, Gourmet Swap, a social market built off the idea connecting communities to home-cooked meals prepared by local Chefs. Example codes include the following technologies: C# / ASP.NET MVC, REST Web API, Angular, Javascript, HTML, CSS.

Web Application structure:
1) Client and server side follows the MVC architecture pattern - using AngularJs and ASP.NET.
2) Using John Popa's Angular style guide for Angular syntax and application structure.
3) Server side enforces dependency injection (DI) design pattern - to promote a loosely coupled application. Unity container used to resolve dependencies. 
4) URL routing is accomplished by using AngularJs UI-Router - a client-side Single Page Application routing framework.
