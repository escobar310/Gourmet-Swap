## Chat Bot for Gourmet Swap
Personally launched an intelligent chat bot to enhance and improve users interactions, experience, and meal searches. Designed conversations to support freeform and more guided interactions through simple text to complex rich cards that contain text, images, and action buttons.

Code is written in C# / ASP.NETusing Microsoft's Cognitive Services (Language Understanding Intelligent Service aka LUIS) and Bot Framework were used.

Please refer to GSwap.Bot/Controllers/MessagesController.cs and  GSwap.Bot/Dialogs/BasicQnAMakerDialog.cs to check out the bulk of my code.
